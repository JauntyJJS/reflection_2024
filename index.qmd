## R4DS Book Club Cohort 9

Despite an unpredictable working schedule in the hospital, I tried to
attend the R for Data Science (R4DS) book club cohort 9, hosted by
[Lydia](https://linktr.ee/lgibson7){target="_blank"} and
[Ken](https://linktr.ee/kenvu){target="_blank"} since August 2023 at a
weekly basis in the [Data Science Learning
Community](https://dslc.io/){target="_blank"} (DSLC) slack
group.<br><br>Join the DSLC slack page at
[https://dslc.io/join](https://dslc.io/join){target="_blank"} @cr-DSLC

It is hard for me to believe that I could stay on with this cohort till
the end when the cohort had the last meeting around February 2024. I
ended up making some new friends online as well.<br><br>See playlist at
[https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3x6DOfs2NGjVMs1NtbWu4s_ZgGhGKnrN](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3x6DOfs2NGjVMs1NtbWu4s_ZgGhGKnrN){target="_blank"}<br><br><a href="#top">Back

## Interprofessional Practice & Education (IPE) Day 2024: Building Bridges, Breaking Barriers {#interprofessional-practice-education-ipe-day-2024-building-bridges-breaking-barriers}

I had attended [IPE
day](https://www.singhealthdukenus.com.sg/amei/pages/ciphe-events.aspx){target="_blank"}
for the first time on 29 Feb 2024. It was an opportunity for healthcare
professional to meet up, share and learn how to improve collaboration
and the quality of care for patients. @cr-IPE

I initially thought that I would be lonely as I was a research officer
who had just started his job in less than a year. However, I was wrong.
The people that I had met were friendly and just wanted to know me as a
person, rather than my limited background in the medical field. [@cr-IPE]{pan-to="500px, 500px" scale-by="2.3"}

One of the highlights of the event is NN**IPE**NDO. It is based on a
collaborative game inspired by a popular multiplayer game,
[Overcooked](https://www.team17.com/games/overcooked){target="_blank"}.
The objective was to earn the most gold coins by making dishes within
the limitations of each team member's assigned role.<br><br>I was
assigned as the cook and had to cut and paste ingredients on the paper
to create a dish but I could not leave the table to get the ingredients.
The role turned out to be great for a quiet observer (and data cleaner)
like me as I am able to create the dishes quickly in spite of the many
ingredients scattered across the table. The team that I was in managed
to get second place.<br><br><a href="#top">Back to top</a> @cr-NNI

## Sing On 3

Not many people may know this but I am actually in a [university alumni
choir](https://linktr.ee/ntuchoir_alumni){target="_blank"}. For someone with limited background and interest in music, it
seems like a miracle that I have been in this singing group for close to
10 years. @cr-singonchoir

For now, I belong to the Tenor section in the choir. @cr-singontenor

On April, the choir managed to have their own concert called Sing On 3:
Contemplation.<br><br>![](images/Sing_On_3.jpg){fig-alt="Poster of Sing On 3 Choir concert."}<br><br>Here is the

to the program booklet. @cr-singonconcert

Learning and memorizing new scores was a challenge for me but I still
managed to pull through a decent performance and catch up with my
university classmates along the way.<br><br><a href="#top">Back to

## International Krakow Choir Festival *Cracovia Cantans* 2024

I was then taken for a wild ride when the choir was preparing for a
[choir
competition](https://www.cracoviacantans.com/previous_editions2024.html){target="_blank"}
in Krakow, Poland on June 2024. Practice during the period of May was
intense as I was not used to learning and memorising scores for a very
short time and was afraid that my body could not keep up with the long
hours of singing. @cr-krakowperform

Nevertheless, the choir managed to obtain a silver diploma in the mixed
choir adults category and a gold diploma in the popular & folk music,
gospel, spirituals category.<br><br><a href="#top">Back to top</a>

## useR! 2024

On July, I was given the chance to attend the [useR! 2024
conference](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/user/){target="_blank"}
at Salzburg, Austria. I am grateful to the organizers for accepting my
abstract and [National Heart Centre Singapore](https://www.nhcs.com.sg/){target="_blank"} for letting me spend some
quality time with the R community. @cr-useR2024

During the conference, I had presented some data extraction and
validation tips on how to deal with formatted tabular data from Excel.<br><br>`r fontawesome::fa(name = "link", fill = "#808080")` [Slides](https://jauntyjjs.github.io/useR-2024){target="_blank"}<br>`r fontawesome::fa(name = "github", fill = "#000000")` [Source Code](https://github.com/JauntyJJS/useR-2024){target="_blank"} @cr-useR2024-present

## European Society of Cardiology (ESC) Congress 2024 {#european-society-of-cardiology-esc-congress-2024}

As a research officer from [National Heart Centre Singapore](https://www.nhcs.com.sg/){target="_blank"}, I am heavily
involved in the [Global Pretest Probability Study of Coronary Artery
Disease (GPS-CAD)
study](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05722145){target="_blank"}.<br><br>My
task involves collecting, cleaning and harmonising clinical data from at
least fourteen different hospitals and clinical trials. The harmonised
data are then sent to other data analysts and statisticians for further
analysis. @cr-gpscad-intro

August 2024 was a significant milestone for the study as it was
presented during a late breaking science session in the [European

## R User Group Singapore (RUGS) November Meetup {#r-user-group-singapore-rugs-november-meetup}

It started when an R enthusiast, [Nien
Xian](https://www.nienxiangtou.com/){target="_blank"} contacted me via
Linkedin around March 2024 and expressed interest in meeting other R
users in Singapore. This led to a series of events that caused the
revivial of the [R User Group Singapore (RUGS)
Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/r-user-group-sg/){target="_blank"} on
November 2024 after its hiatus for a few years, in spite of limited
experience and resources.<br><br><iframe src="https://www.linkedin.com/embed/feed/update/urn:li:share:7270729034731266048" height="500" width="400" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen="" title="Nien Xian's post on R User Group Singapore Meetup on Linkedin"></iframe> @cr-rugs

During the event, I had presented how to create a simple [Quarto
dashboard](https://quarto.org/docs/dashboards/){target="_blank"} of
Singapore’s Fertility rate using the fertility and live birth datasets
that was available at <https://data.gov.sg/><br><br>`r fontawesome::fa(name = "link", fill = "#808080")` [Slides](https://jauntyjjs.github.io/rugs_20241129){target="_blank"}<br>`r fontawesome::fa(name = "github", fill = "#000000")` [Source Code](https://github.com/JauntyJJS/rugs_20241129){target="_blank"} @cr-rugs-present

## Giving Back In December

When people asked me what I would be doing during the festive season of November and December,
I usually reply that I will be assisting the [university choir](https://www.instagram.com/ntuchoir/){target="_blank"}
in caroling as an alumni
to spread the joy of the Christmas season.<br><br>
However, after the Covid-19 pandemic, I was not able to do this for a few years due to a reservist
commitment and not being able to accumulate enough leave from work to help out as I only
started by new job as a research officer in
[National Heart Centre Singapore](https://www.nhcs.com.sg/){target="_blank"}
in 2023.<br><br>This year, I feel blessed that I was able to return and help out once again.
There is always something magical in caroling that is able to connect people together.
<br><br>Here are some videos and photos that was taken by some of the univeristy's choir members.<br><br><a href="#top">Back

## Dance Fitness Progress

:::{focus-on="cr-boy-cry"}

During childhood, I was not physically active as I was not good in
sports and other fitness related activities.

I still remember
that I was scolded during a kickboxing class for punching like a girl,
move as if I was dancing, falling down most of the time and even
punching the instructor by mistake because I was afraid and closed my
eyes.

Most people warned be that I would suffer greatly when I
entered military life.

:::

There was a period after graduating from university that I wanted to
find a physical activity that I can cope and enjoy in spite of my bad
experiences in the past.<br><br>I tried different things from yoga to
mixed martial art and then realized that dance fitness was for me (even
though it is more popular activity for woman rather than man) not
because I was good at dancing but like the R community, the people were
friendly and willing to guide me on the dance steps. @cr-dance-fitness

I then started doing [Kpop X Fitness](https://kpopxfitness.com/){target="_blank"} around 7 years ago and later Zumba
in 2020 from instructor
[Jaenny](https://www.instagram.com/just.being.jaenny/){target="_blank"}
during the COVID period when I feel that I am able to handle a full
one-hour class. Here are some videos and photos that was taken this year
by
[Jaenny](https://www.instagram.com/just.being.jaenny/){target="_blank"}

## Reflections

During reservist in 2021, a kind soul gave me a lift home from my
reservist camp. While driving, he asked me what my hobbies were. "Not
much." was my reply.<br><br>Despite being told by an instructor during my
national service that I write interesting stories about myself, I am someone who
personally avoid looking back about my life or writing reflections. This
is mainly because I am afraid of being embarrassed or laughed at after
sharing about own interests and hobbies. @cr-embarrass

<br>The list can go on…<br><br>

Sometimes, I find it hard to keep a conservation going
because usually the conversation ends abruptly after I have shared that I am not
working on the same thing or I do not know what kind of questions to ask because I have
no clue what the other party is talking about.

:::

Yet looking back at what I have done in 2024, it appears that I have
made a lot of decent achievements and self-fulfilling things in life.<br><br>It
reminds me of the story about the professor showing a piece of white
paper with a black dot to his students and asked them what do they see.
Like the students, I was too blinded and preoccupied by my weaknesses
and failings (represented by the black dot) that I failed to see the
positive things I had done (represented by the white part of the paper)
even though they were so many. @cr-black-dot

Perhaps, I should focus more on taking my eyes away from the black dots
in my life and learn to be more mindful about the blessings and moments
in my life that makes be happy and satisfied. @cr-mindful

The events in 2024 remind me that there are people out there who are
interested in the work that I do, will appreciate my talents and accept my shortcoming.
I just need to have more self love, faith and courage to get up of my comfort zone to find, meet and hopefully have a fruitful relationship with them. @cr-self-love

No matter how poor and unfair our lives can be, how much pain and
suffering we are going through or how lonely and depressed we feel, our
lives on earth are still a gift from God.<br><br>It is all right and normal to feel down, afraid or to be
not at our best sometimes. It is just part of being human. We should not be living life in the shadows.
As long as we are still alive, it is never too late to make the best use of it.<br><br><a href="#top">Back
