It appears that I have\nmade a lot of decent achievements and self-fulfilling things in life.<br><br>It\nreminds me of the story about the professor showing a piece of white\npaper with a black dot to his students and asked them what do they see.\nLike the students, I was too blinded and preoccupied by my weaknesses\nand failings (represented by the black dot) that I failed to see the\npositive things I had done (represented by the white part of the paper)\neven though they were so many. @cr-black-dot\n\nPerhaps, I should focus more on taking my eyes away from the black dots\nin my life and learn to be more mindful about the blessings and moments\nin my life that makes be happy and satisfied. @cr-mindful\n\nThe events in 2024 remind me that there are people out there who are \ninterested in the work that I do, will appreciate my talents and accepting to my short coming.\nI just need to have more self love, faith and courage to get up of my comfort zone to find, meet and hopefully have a fruitful relationship with them. @cr-self-love\n\nNo matter how poor and unfair our lives can be, how much pain and\nsuffering we are going through or how lonely and depressed we feel, our\nlives on earth are still a gift from God. It is all right and normal to feel down, afraid or to be \nnot at your best sometimes. It is just part of being human. We should not be living life in the shadows. \nAs long as we are still alive, it is never too late to make the best use of it.<br><br><a href=\"#top\">Back\nto top</a> @cr-life_is\n\n::: {#cr-embarrass .scale-to-fill}\n![Timid man covering face with hand and peeking through, embarrassing,\nfeeling sorry, shying in\n[Vecteezy](https://www.vecteezy.com/vector-art/7938804-vector-concept-illustration-of-timid-man-covering-face-with-hand-and-peeking-through-embarrassing-feeling-sorry-shying-flat-cartoon-style){target=\"_blank\"}](images/timid-man-covering-face.jpg){fig-alt=\"Cartoon of a timid man covering his face with his hand and peeking through.\" fig-align=\"center\" width=\"70%\"}\n:::\n\n::: {#cr-eggs .scale-to-fill}\n![Eggs in tray on white surface by [Daniel\nReche](https://www.pexels.com/@daniel-reche-718241/){target=\"_blank\"} in\n[Pexels](https://www.pexels.com/photo/eggs-in-tray-on-white-surface-1556707/){target=\"_blank\"}](images/eggs_in_tray_on_white_surface.jpg){fig-alt=\"Cartoon of a few white eggs in an egg carton being hostile to a brown egg because it looks different.\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n:::\n\n::: {#cr-black-dot .scale-to-fill}\n\n![Output from [Gemini 1.5 Flash](https://gemini.google.com/){target=\"_blank\"} using prompt \"Black pen making a dot on a white paper\"](images/black_dot.jpg){fig-alt=\"Black pen making a dot on a white paper\" fig-align=\"center\"width=\"70%\"}\n\n:::\n\n::: {#cr-mindful .scale-to-fill}\n\n![](images/mindful_1.jpg){fig-alt=\"Picture showing the values of mindfulness\" fig-align=\"center\" width=\"60%\"}\n\n![](images/mindful_2.jpg){fig-alt=\"Picture showing the values of mindfulness in details\" fig-align=\"center\" width=\"60%\"}\n\n:::\n\n::: {#cr-self-love .scale-to-fill}\n\n![](images/self_love.jpg){fig-alt=\"Picture of cards showing the need to have self love, take it easy and to have positive vibes.\" fig-align=\"center\" width=\"80%\"}\n\n:::\n\n::: {#cr-life_is .scale-to-fill}\n\n![Life is a gift from God poster from [Char Kantha Martin Facebook post](https://www.facebook.com/groups/620889571585087/posts/2293341987673162/){target=\"_blank\"}](images/life_is.jpg){fig-alt=\"Infograph showing that each person is given the gift of life to live, learn and to live a legacy.\" fig-align=\"center\"}\n\n:::\n\n:::\n\n## R Session and Packages Used\n\nHere are the R packages used.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: R Package Used\n#| title: \"ð¦ R Packages Used\"\n\nget_r_package_info <- function() {\n\n  r_package_table <- sessioninfo::package_info()\n  rownames(r_package_table) <- NULL\n\n  r_package_table <- r_package_table |>\n    tibble::as_tibble() |>\n    dplyr::mutate(\n      version = ifelse(is.na(r_package_table$loadedversion),\n                       r_package_table$ondiskversion,\n                       r_package_table$loadedversion)) |>\n    dplyr::filter(.data[[\"attached\"]] == TRUE) |>\n    dplyr::select(\n      dplyr::any_of(c(\"package\", \"version\",\n                      \"date\", \"source\"))\n    )\n\n  return(r_package_table)\n\n}\n\nget_r_package_info() |>\n  reactable::reactable(\n    defaultPageSize = 5,\n    paginationType = \"jump\",\n  )\n\n```\n\nHere is the R session used to generate this webpage.\n\n```{r}\n#| label: R Session Info\n#| title: \"ð» R Session Info\"\n\nget_quarto_version <- function(\n    test_sys_path = FALSE,\n    test_no_path = FALSE\n) {\n\n  #

People I know goes for holidays during the November or December but I stay in Singapore and do caroling instead. People I know uses [Tiktok](https://www.tiktok.com/){target=\"_blank\"} and [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/){target=\"_blank\"} to find the latest trends of things \nbut I use [X](https://x.com/?lang=en){target=\"_blank\"} \nand later [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/){target=\"_blank\"}, [Bluesky](https://bsky.app/){target=\"_blank\"} and \n[Fosstodon](https://fosstodon.org/){target=\"_blank\"} instead. \nThe list can go onâ¦<br><br>Sometimes, I find it hard to keep a conservation going \nbecause usually the conversation ends abruptly after I have shared that I am not \nworking on the same thing or I do not know what kind of questions to ask because I have \nno clue what the other party is talking about. @cr-eggs\n\nYet, looking back at what I have done in 2024. It appears that I have\nmade a lot of decent achievements and self-fulfilling things in life.<br><br>It\nreminds me of the story about the professor showing a piece of white\npaper with a black dot to his students and asked them what do they see.\nLike the students, I was too blinded and preoccupied by my weaknesses\nand failings (represented by the black dot) that I failed to see the\npositive things I had done (represented by the white part of the paper)\neven though they were so many. @cr-black-dot\n\nPerhaps, I should focus more on taking my eyes away from the black dots\nin my life and learn to be more mindful about the blessings and moments\nin my life that makes be happy and satisfied. @cr-mindful\n\nThe events in 2024 remind me that there are people out there who are \ninterested in the work that I do, will appreciate my talents and accepting to my short coming.\nI just need to have more self love, faith and courage to get up of my comfort zone to find, meet and hopefully have a fruitful relationship with them. @cr-self-love\n\nNo matter how poor and unfair our lives can be, how much pain and\nsuffering we are going through or how lonely and depressed we feel, our\nlives on earth are still a gift from God. It is all right and normal to feel down, afraid or to be \nnot at your best sometimes. It is just part of being human. We should not be living life in the shadows. \nAs long as we are still alive, it is never too late to make the best use of it.<br><br><a href=\"#top\">Back\nto top</a> @cr-life_is\n\n:::
